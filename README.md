# JavaLoggingTemplate
This is a java logging template for logging in java and writing to a json file.


This will require small changes to work within your project but advatages of the package is that it is conatined within the 3 classes and can be writen to and endpoint or as a json file. 

NOTE: I would advise wrapping this in a package with a relevent name.
